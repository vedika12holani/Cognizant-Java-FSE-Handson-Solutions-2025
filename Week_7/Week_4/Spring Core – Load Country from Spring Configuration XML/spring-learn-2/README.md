# Spring Core â€“ Load Country from Spring Configuration XML

## Objective
An airlines website is going to support booking on four countries.  
There will be a dropdown on the home page to select the respective country.  
It is also important to store the two-character ISO code of each country.

| Code | Name          |
|------|---------------|
| US   | United States |
| DE   | Germany       |
| IN   | India         |
| JP   | Japan         |

The above data has to be stored in a Spring configuration file.  
We will write a program to read this configuration file and display the details.
