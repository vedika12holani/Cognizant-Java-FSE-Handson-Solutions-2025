# 🛠️ Problem Statement
Build two independent Spring Boot microservices — Account Service and Loan Service — for a bank. 

Each service exposes a RESTful GET API that returns dummy account or loan details based on the provided account number.

The services must run on separate ports (Account on 8080, Loan on 8081).
